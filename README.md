1. Code Structure
The code is organized into a single class called MobiusStrip which encapsulates all functionality:

__init__: Initializes the strip with parameters R, w, and n, and generates a meshgrid.

compute_surface: Computes the 3D coordinates (X, Y, Z) using the parametric equations.

plot: Visualizes the Möbius strip in 3D using matplotlib.

approximate_surface_area: Numerically estimates the surface area using the magnitude of the cross product of partial derivatives.

approximate_edge_length: Approximates the length of the boundary edge by discretizing the curve.

2. Surface Area Approximation
To approximate the surface area, we compute the partial derivatives of the position vector with respect to u and v, then take the cross product of these vectors at each mesh point. The magnitude of the cross product gives the infinitesimal area element:
Area≈∑∥∂r/∂u×∂r/∂v∥⋅Δu⋅Δv


4. Challenges Faced
Numerical stability: Calculating the cross product and its magnitude over a discretized grid required careful attention to avoid numerical instability.

Edge length approximation: Since the Möbius strip twists, following a consistent edge required using just the upper boundary at v = w/2.

Visualization: Ensuring the strip renders smoothly at lower resolutions was tricky, so n was increased for better results.
